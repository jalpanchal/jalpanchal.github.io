## 🧠 About

I work at the intersection of:

- **Sensing Hardware**
- **Signal Processing**
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**

I enjoy transforming noisy biosignals into meaningful insights, with experience across heart rate and blood pressure estimation, motion artifact removal, and biofeedback algorithm development. My portfolio spans clinical validation, embedded systems, and user-focused solutions.
